GoldVision: Gold Price Predictor

GoldVision is a time-series forecasting project designed to predict the future trends of gold prices using historical data. The project utilizes Facebook Prophet for forecasting and provides visual insights into the price predictions over time. It aims to assist users in making informed decisions related to gold investments.

Features

📊 Time Series Forecasting: Utilizes Facebook Prophet for accurate and reliable gold price predictions.

📅 Custom Seasonality: Adds quarterly seasonality to improve prediction accuracy.

📈 Visualizations: Interactive graphs displaying actual vs. predicted values, along with confidence intervals.

🔮 Prediction Horizon: Predicts gold prices up to 72 months into the future.

Technologies Used

Python: The programming language used for this project.

Facebook Prophet: A forecasting tool for generating time-series predictions.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.

Matplotlib: For generating static visualizations.

Seaborn: Provides additional visualization features for easier interpretation.

Scikit-learn: Used for data clustering or any machine learning models.


Installation

To get started with GoldVision locally, ensure that you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:


pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn fbprophet scikit-learn

How It Works

Data Preparation: The historical gold price data is loaded into the program, and necessary preprocessing is done using Pandas.

Model Training: The data is then used to train a Facebook Prophet model.

Prediction: The trained model generates predictions for the next 72 months.

Visualization: Predictions are visualized against actual values, and confidence intervals are displayed for a better understanding of forecast reliability.


Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Barathkalyan/GoldVision-price-predictor.git

Run the script predict_gold_price.py to train the model and generate forecasts.

Modify the input data (CSV file) or tweak the model parameters to suit your needs.

Future Improvements

🌐 Web Interface: Develop a user-friendly web-based interface to allow non-technical users to interact with the model.

📈 External Data Integration: Incorporate additional factors like inflation rates, stock market performance, or geopolitical events to improve model accuracy.

🔄 Model Updates: Periodically retrain the model with new data to ensure the predictions remain relevant and accurate.
